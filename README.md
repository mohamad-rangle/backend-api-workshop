# Working with Backend APIs

Rangle Academy Workshop

### Building and Running

0. clone project
0. `npm install`
0. `npm run present`


### Modifying and Contributing

Content is in content folder, currently kept entirely in `deck.md`.

### TODO

- Include an optional PDF-generation build step
- Move notes and exercises to accompanying docs
- Add extra content skeletons for advanced or alternate talks
- Use a different plugin or build-pipeline, to support markdown imports
  - subsequently refactor `deck.md` to allow for componentized deck
